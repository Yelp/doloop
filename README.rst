**doloop** is a simple system for keeping things with unique IDs updated. It is
concurrency-safe and supports prioritization.

**doloop**'s only dependency is
`MySQL <http://dev.mysql.com>`_; it does not require you to
install or administer a separate server.

**doloop** works with any DBI-compliant Python MySQL library, including:

- `MySQL Connector <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/>`_
- `MySQL-Python <http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `oursql <https://launchpad.net/oursql>`_
- `PyMySQL <https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/>`_

See http://packages.python.org/doloop for tutorial and documentation.
