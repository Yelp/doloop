v0.3.0, 2012-01-31 -- Just lock the tables
 * explicitly lock loop tables rather than trusting MySQL
 * no retry on deadlocks or lock wait timeouts (no longer needed)
 * allow storage engines other than InnoDB

v0.2.1, 2011-11-02 -- stats() bugfix
 * min_update_time and max_update_time are no longer reversed (Issue #12)

v0.2.0, 2011-10-19 -- Learning from experience
 * Updates to stats()
   * Cleaner output (Issue #4)
   * We now collect update-time stats for locked/bumped IDs (Issue #5)
   * No delay thresholds by default (Issue #13)
   * There is now a 'total' stat
 * should now work with any DBI-compliant MySQL driver (Issue #12)
   * tested MySQLdb, pymysql, oursql, mysql.connector
   * update()'s return value was useless before; now it's official.
 * read-only mode for testing/dry runs (Issue #9)
 * breaking ties in get() (e.g. for new IDs) is now left to the database
